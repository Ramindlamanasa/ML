Optimizing Power Consumption in Zone 1 Based on Environmental & Meteorological Factors
Objective:
To predict and minimize power consumption in Wellington's Zone 1 by analyzing environmental influences using machine learning.
Dataset:
•	Collected weather-related features: Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Air Quality, Rainfall, etc.
•	Cleaned non-numeric values (e.g., "5.488 dc") and removed irrelevant columns like Cloudiness.
Approach:
•	Used Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn) for analysis and modeling.
•	Applied Random Forest Regressor with train/test split (80/20).
•	Evaluation through Mean Squared Error and visual plots.
Key Insights:
•	Temperature and Diffuse Solar Flows had the highest impact on energy use.
•	Accurate predicted vs actual alignment showed model reliability.
•	Feature importance guided optimization strategies for load shifting and HVAC control.
Deliverables:
•	A themed PowerPoint presentation with heatmaps, plots, and speaker notes.
•	A predictive pipeline ready for deployment into real-time systems or dashboards.
